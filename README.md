Coursemap is a convienent application that allow users to easily create a four year plan, instead of creating it by themselves through excel or downloading a template. There are many helpful features users can incorpate in forming their plan, such as downloading their plan into a printable pdf, autofilling their courses, etc. CourseMap also provides a progress bar to track the amount of units needed for graduation and the overall GPA.
